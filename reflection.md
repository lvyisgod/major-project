# reflection

## what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- I would give myself the advice not work so much that is activly hurts sleep
- and if im stuck on one part to be okay with moving on and finding the answer later

## did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
- yes I completed all my needs to have list I wish i could've completed my nice to have list too
- by adding a info page and titles to each section

## What was the hardest part of the project?
- the hardest part of this project was to not get tunnel visioned on a part if it didn't work at first
- and being ok to scrap some parts that didn't work not being able to see that this was a problem at first
- because I would keep trying to brute force stuff to work the really couldn't

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- I couldn't fix the CORS error you sometime get when loading the qna and toxicity bot but I think
- I understand why the error happens but can't do anything to stop it except by making the page to reload
